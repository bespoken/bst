## Overview
***Please note - as of version 1.1.0, what was known as the speak command has become [utter](utter).***  
*This new version works directly with AVS - we think you will love it!*  
*Run an `npm update bespoken-tools -g` to get this latest functionality.*

The speak command communicates to a virtual device to test your skills with text as if they were voice commands.

It allows you to test your skill without using a physical device and it will return the generated audio response converted to text as well as the card data and possible audio streams that could have been returned.

## Speaking

To invoke the speak command, simply type:
```
$ bst speak <UTTERANCE>
```

For example:
```
$ bst speak Tell My Skill hello
```

On the first run the command will provide the instructions to obtain a token. You will see an output like this:

```
BST: v1.0.8  Node: v7.10.1

You need a token for this option to work, get it here:

	https://apps.bespoken.io/dashboard/skills/skill-Generated-Name/validation
	(Bespoken Dashboard account required for use of this feature)

Then try again with:

	bst speak --token <ProvidedToken> <Speech to try>
```


Provide the token generated by following the instructions on the provided link.
```
	bst speak --token <ProvidedToken> Tell My Skill hello
```

Now you will get the expected response
```
	Transcript:
	Hello from My Skill.
```

From then on you can use the command without the token.
